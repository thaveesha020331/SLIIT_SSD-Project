- **Updated Order Model**: Added `payment` and `paymentStatus` fields

### Frontend
- **Component**: `components/Thaveesha/PaymentForm.jsx` - Payment UI form
- **CSS**: `components/Thaveesha/PaymentForm.css` - Beautiful styling

   - PCI compliance for card data
   - SSL certificate
   - Rate limiting on payment endpoints

3. **Payment Webhook**
   - Handle payment gateway webhooks
   - Update payment status automatically
   - Send confirmations

4. **Admin Dashboard**
   - View all payments
   - Payment reconciliation
   - Transaction reports

5. **Email Notifications**
   - Payment confirmation email
   - Refund confirmation email
   - Failure notifications

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Not authorized" error
**Solution**: Make sure JWT token is included in Authorization header

### Issue: "Order not found"
**Solution**: Verify order ID is correct and belongs to authenticated user

### Issue: "Payment already completed"
**Solution**: Each order can only have one completed payment. Create a new order to test again.

### Issue: CORS error
**Solution**: Ensure frontend is running on `http://localhost:5173` (registered in CORS config)

### Issue: Payment endpoint not found
**Solution**: Restart the server after adding payment routes
